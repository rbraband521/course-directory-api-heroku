# Course Directory: REST API

This is the REST API for my Course Directory project. Once a user is authorized, they can Create, Read, Update and Delete courses. This project also POSTgres in order to deploy the database on Heroku. 

**To Run Locally**

If you'd like to run the program locally clone the full repo at <https://github.com/rbraband521/FullStackApp>. *This repo cannot be ran locally because there is no seed file.* 

**Online Database**

The database can be found [here](https://safe-garden-88273.herokuapp.com/), you can navigate to specific routes via the URL. 

**Full Website**

If you'd like to see the full application in action visit [here](https://course-directory-full-stack-app.vercel.app/).

  #### In order to utilize POSTgres, it was necessary to create migration and seeder files and update the models to represent the correct association. I have written a short tutorial on this process which can be found [here](https://github.com/rbraband521/Sequelize-Model-Associations/blob/main/Associations.md).
